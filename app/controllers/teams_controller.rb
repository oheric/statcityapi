    #we then persist all of these changes to mongodb using the @post.save method call
    if @team.save

      #here is the tricky part...what we do here is essentially redirect_to our one_path, and we pass the @id as a parameter,
      #so the one_path(which is our 'one' action method) thinks it's getting called like normal with the :post being an id,        #so it just behaves like it  normally does, grabbing a post from the db with an id that matches 
      #:post(which we have set here to have an id as a value). Since we already saved our comment in the 
      #db, the 'one' method pulls out the updated post.
